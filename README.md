Canvas Device Motion

This project replicates the Natraj image of the Bridget Riley canvas using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The code includes a listener for the devicemotion event, to be notified of phone movement and a call to requestAnimationFrame().
The canvas responsively changes as you move your phone from side to side, or up and down.
